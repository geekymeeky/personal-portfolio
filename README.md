# Personal Portfolio

Hi, I'm Srijan!
I'm currently a student at Calcutta Institute of Engineering and Management, studying Computer Science and Engineering. I'm passionate about technology, business, and entrepreneurship. I'm also a huge fan of the outdoors, and I love to connect with people. I'm currently working on a few projects, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

### [Srijan's Portfolio](https://srijankgupta.vercel.app/)
This is my personal portfolio, which I built using Svelte. It's hosted on Vercel, and it's a single-page application. I'm currently working on adding more projects to it.
